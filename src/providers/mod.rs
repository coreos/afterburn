//! Providers
//!
//! These are the providers which coreos-metadata knows how to retrieve metadata
//! from. Internally, they handle the ins and outs of each providers metadata
//! services, and externally, they provide a function to fetch that metadata in
//! a regular format.
//!
//! To add a provider, put a `pub mod provider;` line in this file, export a
//! function to fetch the metadata, and then add a match line in the top-level
//! `fetch_metadata()` function in metadata.rs.
